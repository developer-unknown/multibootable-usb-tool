This repository contains the tools you need to create a multibootable usb flash drive.
This method works for both UEFI and Legacy systems.
Things you'll need:

Multiple ISO files
1 USB flash drive that is big enough for all your iso files
__________________________________________________________________

First, install YUMI-UEFI-0.0.4.0.exe (For UEFI Only)
If you have a Legacy system, install YUMI-2.0.9.0.exe from this repository.

Next, open YUMI and selct "I agree" when the license pops up.
Then, select the usb flash drive that you want to put you iso files on from the list.
Finally select the Linux distro that you want to put on your usb and then browse for the iso file assuming you have it.
Lastly, check the box that wipes the disk. If you using the Legacy version of YUMI, choose "Format D: as NTFS". The drive letter might say something different for you though.

Continue and wait for it to finish. When you are done, you can add more iso's by redoing the steps above. You will choose a different iso that time.
